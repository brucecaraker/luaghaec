I've read so many time along this subreddit that combining Markdown/Latex and Git can do wonders for the writing workflow. And since I'm starting the heavy writing part of my PhD I would like to k 1st - What exactly this combination allows me to do and how it is better then the common alternatives like MS Word 2nd - How can i start with it? Any good resource for starting with it? 3rd - which softwares do you guys use for this combo Thanks hope you guys can help me which softwares ATLAS High Speed Solid End Mills for Aluminum.

Hi all, I am battling between Word and LaTeX. I prefer LaTeX, my advisor prefers Word. I'm sure a lot of people have been in a similar situation. What would be the best system/method to balance both? Or should I just stick to Word as my boss requires? I have been using latex for over two years now, I tried word several times and every time it seemed way less convenient in general formatting and math formulas. What helped those of you in a similar situation. A command line utility for managing text files: It's either a personal wiki, file manager or note-taking tool depending on how you want to use it.

So I passed my quals in the spring and this quarter I'm starting the formal process of writing my dissertation. I'm looking for advice/recommendations about programs and software for staying organized and writing my diss. In the past––for my undergrad and masters thesis––I simply used Word, didn't really take advantage of the advanced features, and painstakingly formatted the document and the citations/bibliography at the end which was a nightmare. For my diss I not only don't want to go throu. I'm in a cohort of ~100 people who will spend the next 6 months studying from a prescribed textbook for a large MCQ exam. I would like to make an anki deck of practice MCQ questions and share this deck with everyone, but creating this deck will be an ongoing process. Is there any way they can download the in-progress deck to their personal account but also have the deck automatically download any new cards hey everyone, I'm looking for a decent software solution for scanning and managing my documents on Manjaro. On Windows I'm using FileCenter for that job which I'm more than satisfied with - but it's on Windows :/. But on Linux I don't seem to find a program that comes even close to FileCenter. Especially in combination with my FUJITSU ScanSnap iX500 which has the potential to scan a lot of duplex pages in a short amount time - but not with the few programs I tried so far on linux since there. I just finished writing my first homework assignment in Latex through ShareLatex, but am quickly realizing that I much rather use my own text editor. I’ve gotten Atom to work with latex, but it’s pretty inefficient and I was wondering how I could get a more efficient and cleaner editing workflow through latexmk or some command and a text editor. I’m not the most comfortable with text editors + command line compiling, but I’m trying to learn before I enter University. Right now I’ve Hello colleagues, I am wondering what you are currently using as a way to share documentation and procedures with your colleagues. We are currently using Onenote, in which we keep literally everything: Documentation, procedures, technical documents, etc. It's very simple to work with, you simply start typing, you can paste screenshots and other documents in it, and is very quick to search in. Most importantly, we have a script that syncs all these onenote documents to our local computers. I have a large folder of ~ 4 GB. This folder has python source code, Matlab source code, a lot ~50-80 MB video files as well as pdf files. I was originally planning to put them all under git source control and put them in github, but I found that it made everything really slow. Further, github started complaining that I am using too much of their bandwidth. I am thinking that a better approach would be to keep the avi or other large files in the similar structure, but to only put the source.
